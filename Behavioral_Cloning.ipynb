Batch Normalization is a technique that normalize the outputs of a layer which are the inputs for the next in our model, basically it does something close to the normalization we did to the images before feeding them to our model. This process increases training time due to its added computations, but it stabilizes layer inputs that in turn gives a more stable predictions and a faster convergence. Apart from the gained convergence speed it allows the model to use higher learning rates without sacrificing accuracy and it also has some regularization qualities.\n",

Through navigating the interwebs searching for answer I found out [this gem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05134.pdf), an amazing paper which was published earlier this year that explains the *disharmony* between batch normalization and dropout. \n",

I managed to tryout different top cropping for track 2 to include more of the image because the track had ascending and descending slopes that occupy more of the image than the flat track 1, however, this change didn't produce any gains.\n",

Python generator is a method or a technique that behaves like an iterator and loads items when needed using the `yield` that is like a `return`, but keeps all the generator's variables intact.*Keras* `fit_generator()` uses generators to only load data batch by batch for a more optimized and data conscious approach, this reduced the memory consumbsion form more than `10GB` to `2GB` max even for high batch sizes like `512` and `1024`.

    "# Training Approach \n",
    "____\n",
    "Here I'll be talking about how I went about training my data, which approaches did I try, and the final model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "After choosing the Model architecture I still had to decide on how to train, \n",
    "* Do I have to record recovery laps?\n",
    "* whats the best dropout value? \n",
    "* should I train each track by itself or combine them? \n",
    "* should I use augmentation? \n",
    "* how many epochs should I run? \n",
    "* do I change my image to gray? \n",
    "* should I include the throttle value in my prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recovery Laps \n",
    "\n",
    "I found out that I didn't need to record any recovery laps after using all three *left*, *center*, and *right* camera images the addition of the *left* and *right* images and their corrections made the model recover from the worst deviations when I tried to mess up the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout\n",
    "So after training the model for on a lot of architectures and observing the different dropout values I settled on `0.3` dropout because there is only one dropout layer at the end of the model, this value work really well it let the model train and at the same time prevented overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "So I trained each track and got really good results with the Nvidia architecture, and after modifying the architecture the model was robust and consistent thats why I considered training both track on it which is why I also added the shadow augmentation to generalize between both tracks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the combined images form both the Lake and the jungle tracks \n",
    "![combined_tracks_data_histogram_all_cameras_flipped.png](./assets/combined_tracks_data_histogram_all_cameras_flipped.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "I started training with just **flipping** the images which balanced out the data's distribution and provided more data, but after training the model on both tracks I decided to add the **random shadow** to better generalize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained different architectures on `10` epochs to check if they have potential then on `20` I even trained a lot of them on `30` epochs which took about an hour each; However, after hours and hours of training I discovered *Keras early stopping*  callback which is amazing for the training time and even model quality, it stops training if the model *validation loss* or  other metric doesn't decrease for a certain amount of epochs which I set to  `3`. Unfortunately it was little too late for I used it on the last 2 training runs. I also used *Keras checkpointer* callback which saves the model at its lowest *validation loss*, it combined with early stopping made sure that I got the best run and did not train for many epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "I as usual opted for the powerful *Adamoptimizer* as it takes care of setting and changing the learning rate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grayscaling \n",
    "\n",
    "I trained the model on <span style=\"color:gray;\">gray</span> images and got somewhat worst results on the track, so I stuck with the colored <span style=\"color:red;\">R</span><span style=\"color:green;\">G</span><span style=\"color:blue;\">B</span> images .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multivariant \n",
    "\n",
    "I also trained the model to multivariant values steering angle as usual, and throttle. It gave a workable result, but it wasn't up to par with the single variable regression. Theres a saved model of the multivariant approach in the main directory if you want to check it out.\n"

The class has some neat tricks for training that takes advantage of *Keras* awesome features.\n",

    "This project was really fun and I learned many things while working on it and wasted a lot of time training where I could've been using early stopping all along, well you live and learn. I found this project really rewarding and the feeling I got the first time the car navigated through the track was a feeling of pride, no matter how wonky or drunk the car seemed to be I was proud of ***it***. I used cool new tools like the simulator and got introduced to **Keras** which is a huge plus, also learning to create **python** generators and creating my own was a really good experience . I even developed a good training pipeline that I intend on reusing and improve in the future. The project made me explore different concepts and in constructing the model architecture many concepts and techniques became a lot clearer, most importantly having *dropout* and *batch normalization* work together in the same model. All n all this project taught me many concepts in the span of a week, this project raised the bar I hope the next projects will be as exciting and fun as this one."
